We need a mechanism that will accept requests on predefined ports (e.g., 80 and 443) and forward them to Kubernetes Services.

Kubernetes volumes solve the need to preserve the state across container crashes. 

ConfigMaps allow us to “inject” configurations into containers. The source of the configurations can be files, directories, or literal values. The destination can be files or environment variables.
