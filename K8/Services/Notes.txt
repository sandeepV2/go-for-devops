1. With 2 containers in 1 pod (db and API) we cannot scale both the services
   independently.

2. Even if we launch all the containers saperately, The ip adress would change
   on every replica set healing or creating. 

There is need for static names for inter communication between the pods.

We can use the kubectl expose command to expose a resource as a new Kubernetes Service.

Other type of services.
ClusterIP, NodePort
LoadBalancer (The LoadBalancer type is only useful when combined with the cloud providerâ€™s load balancer.)

API service -> EndPoint controller -> Kube proxy (iptables)-> kube-dns 

Communication from within the nodes (NodePort) using kube-proxy.
Communication from outside the nodes (TargatPort) using kube-dns.
